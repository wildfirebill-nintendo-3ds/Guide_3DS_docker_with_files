    + Close everything that may be using the SD card, such as any File Explorer windows.
    + If this issue persists, try reformatting the card to NTFS in File Explorer, close that window when it's done, and re-attempt the guiformat process.

* guiformat shows the error "GetLastError()=1117"
    + Your SD card write-protection switch may be [enabled](/images/sdlock.png). The lock must be flipped upwards to allow writing to the SD card (including formatting).
