# Installing boot9strap (ntrboot)



## What You Need

* A magnet that triggers the sleep mode of your console (if using a folding style console)
* Your ntrboot flashed flashcart
* The latest release of [SafeB9SInstaller](_files/SafeB9SInstaller-20170605-122940.zip) (direct download)
* The latest release of [boot9strap](_files/boot9strap-1.4.zip) (direct download)
* The latest release of [Luma3DS](_files/Luma3DSv13.3.3.zip) (the Luma3DS `.zip` file)

## Instructions

### Section I - Prep Work

1. Power off your console
1. Insert your console's SD card into your computer
    + This is the SD card from your 3DS, *not* the SD card from your flashcart
1. Copy `SafeB9SInstaller.firm` from the SafeB9SInstaller `.zip` to the root of your SD card and rename it to `boot.firm`
    + The root of the SD card refers to the initial directory on your SD card where you can see the Nintendo 3DS folder, but are not inside of it
1. Create a folder named `boot9strap` on the root of your console's SD card
1. Copy `boot9strap.firm` and `boot9strap.firm.sha` from the boot9strap `.zip` to the `/boot9strap/` folder on your console's SD card

    :::

1. Reinsert your SD card into your console
1. Power on your console

### Section II - ntrboot

1. Use the magnet to find the spot on your console where the sleep sensor is triggered
    + This step is not needed on the old 2DS (which has a sleep mode switch)
1. Power off your console
1. Insert your flashcart into your console
1. Place the magnet on your console to trigger the sleep sensor
    + On old 2DS, you should instead enable the sleep mode switch
1. Hold (Start) + (Select) + (X) + (Power) for several seconds, then release the buttons
    + It may take a few attempts to get this to work because the positioning is awkward
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller
1. Remove the magnet from your console
    + On old 2DS, you should instead disable the sleep mode switch

### Section III - Installing boot9strap

In this section, you will install custom firmware onto your console.

1. When prompted, input the key combo given on the top screen to install boot9strap
    + If a step on the lower screen has red-colored text, and you are not prompted to input a key combo, [follow this troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting-ntrboot)
1. Once it is completed, force your console to power off by holding down the power button
    + Your console will only boot to the SafeB9SInstaller screen until the next section is completed

### Section IV - Configuring Luma3DS

1. Insert your console's SD card into your computer
1. Delete `boot.firm` from the root of your SD card
1. Copy everything from the Luma3DS `.zip` to the root of your SD card
1. Reinsert your SD card into your console
1. Power on your console

Continue to [Finalizing Setup](finalizing-setup)

The following is an optional section that will allow you to restore your flashcart to its original state (to allow it to be used for its standard functions).

Note that the Acekard 2i retains its ability to launch `.nds` files while having the ntrboot exploit installed. This only applies when the Acekard 2i is in an NDS or custom firmware 3DS! While the ntrboot exploit is installed to the Acekard 2i, it will be unable to launch `.nds` files on DSi or stock 3DS systems.

Do not follow this section until you have completed the rest of the instructions on this page.

### Section V - Removing ntrboot

#### What You Need

* The latest release of [ntrboot_flasher](_files/ntrboot_flasher.firm) (`ntrboot_flasher.firm`)
* The flashrom backup corresponding to your flashcart
    + Note that if you followed [Flashing ntrboot (3DS Multi System)](flashing-ntrboot-(3ds-multi-system)), the flashrom backup already exists in the correct location and does not need to be downloaded
    + Note that if you followed [Flashing ntrboot (3DS Single System)](flashing-ntrboot-(3ds-single-system)) or [Flashing ntrboot (NDS)](flashing-ntrboot-(nds)), the flashrom backup already exists on your flashcart's SD card and should be copied to the location specified below
    + If you do not know which HW revision you have, just try each for your cart of them. Only the correct one will allow your flashcart to launch properly from the HOME Menu, but flashing the wrong one will not brick the cart
