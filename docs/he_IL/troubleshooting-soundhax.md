This page offers troubleshooting advice for commonly encountered issues with the "Installing boot9strap (Soundhax)" page, which is used on system versions between 1.0.0 and 11.3.0.

## Issues with Soundhax

:::details Red/purple/pink and white screen after running Soundhax

If your console is on system version 9.4.0, 9.5.0, or 9.6.0, you may be encountering a bug with an old version of universal-otherapp. Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest).

If your console is not on those firmwares, it likely indicates that you already have custom firmware. You should [check for CFW](checking-for-cfw).

:::details "An error has occurred, forcing the software to close..." (white message box)

There is an issue with your `otherapp.bin` file (it is missing, misplaced, or corrupted). Download the latest release of [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) and place it on the root of your SD card.

You may also have the wrong Soundhax file for your console, region and version. Verify that your console details are correct and redownload your Soundhax file from [here](http://soundhax.com), then place it on the root of your SD card, replacing the existing one.

If the above doesn't fix your issue, and you are using an Old 3DS / Old 3DS XL / Old 2DS, you may be encountering an issue involving cartridge updates. Take another look at the system version. If the number before the letter is 4 or lower (e.g. 11.3.0-**4**U), replace the Soundhax file on the root of your SD card with the one from [here](http://soundhax.686178.xyz/frankenfirm.html?crash).

If none of these fix your issue, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.
