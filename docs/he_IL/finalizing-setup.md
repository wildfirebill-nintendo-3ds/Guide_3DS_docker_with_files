# Finalizing Setup

## Required Reading

On the previous page, you installed boot9strap, a custom firmware loader that loads the file `boot.firm` from SD card or NAND (internal memory). In this case, we are using Luma3DS by [LumaTeam](https://github.com/LumaTeam/) as our `boot.firm` to patch the console, allowing it to run homebrew software.

On this page, we will make critical system file backups and install some homebrew programs. Most of these steps will be automated using a script that you will run on your console.

::: info

The script will install the following applications:

- **FBI** by Steveice10 _(installs CIA formatted applications)_
- **Homebrew Launcher Loader** by PabloMK7 _(runs Homebrew Launcher, for 3DSX format homebrew)_
- **Anemone3DS** by astronautlevel2 _(installs custom themes, splashes, and badges)_
- **Checkpoint** by BernardoGiordano/FlagBrew _(manages 3DS/DS game save data)_
- **ftpd** by mtheall _(allows wireless 3DS SD card access over FTP)_
- **Universal-Updater** by Universal-Team _(on-device app store for downloading homebrew over Wi-Fi)_
- **GodMode9** by d0k3 _(multipurpose tool for extracting data from internal memory or cartridges)_

If you don't want one of these applications, you can remove them after you have finished this page by navigating to System Settings -> Data Management -> Nintendo 3DS -> Software. (GodMode9 cannot be removed in this way and is generally required for other functions.)

::: details Source code links (optional)

All applications installed on this guide are open-source. If you are interested in seeing how they work, or would like to leave a star to show your appreciation, their source code is linked here:

## Compatibility Notes

::: info

If your previous CFW setup was EmuNAND-based and you wish to move the contents of your EmuNAND/RedNAND to SysNAND, follow [Move EmuNAND](move-emunand) before following this page. If you don't know what an EmuNAND is, this doesn't apply to you.

## What You Need

- [x_finalize_helper.firm](https://github.com/hacks-guide/finalize/releases/latest/download/x_finalize_helper.firm) (direct download)
- [finalize.romfs](https://github.com/hacks-guide/finalize/releases/latest/download/finalize.romfs) (direct download)

## Instructions

### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will copy the files necessary to follow the rest of the instructions on this page.

1. Power off your console
2. תכניסו את ה-SD שלכם למחשב
3. Copy `finalize.romfs` to the root of your SD card
4. Open the `luma` folder on your SD card and create a folder named `payloads` inside, if it does not already exist
5. Copy `x_finalize_helper.firm` to the `payloads` folder
6. Reinsert your SD card into your console

The screenshot below indicates the minimum SD card layout that is required to follow this page. You may have extra files or folders on your SD card, depending on your previous setup or the method that you followed.

### Section II - Updating the System

In this section, you will update your system to the latest version, which is safe to do with custom firmware.

<!--@include: ./_include/sysupdate.md -->

### Section III - RTC and DSP setup

In this section, you will sync your 3DS internal clock with the actual time and dump the sound firmware (which is necesssary for some homebrew software to use sound properly).

1. Press (Left Shoulder) + (D-Pad Down) + (Select) at the same time to open the Rosalina menu
   - If one of these buttons is broken, download [config.ini](/assets/config.ini) and put it in your `luma` folder, replacing the existing one. This will change the Rosalina menu key combination to (X) + (Y)
2. תבחרו ב "Miscellaneous options"
3. Select "Dump DSP firmware"
4. Press (B) to continue
5. Select "Nullify user time offset"
6. Press (B) to continue
7. תלחצו (B) כדי לחזור לתפריט הראשי של Rosalina
8. תלחצו (B) כדי לצאת מהתפריט של Rosalina

### Section IV - Setup Script

In this section, you will use a series of scripts to automate homebrew installation, SD card cleanup, and system file backup.

1. Power off your console
2. Press and hold (X), and while holding (X), power on your console. This will launch the Finalizing Setup Helper
   - If you boot to the HOME Menu, your `payloads` folder may be incorrectly spelled, or `x_finalize_helper.firm` may be in the wrong location
   - If you encounter an error, consult the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting-finalizing-setup) page
3. After a few seconds, your console should automatically boot into GodMode9
   - From this point forward, you can access GodMode9 by holding (Start) while powering on your console
   - Holding (X) on boot will no longer do anything
4. If necessary, configure GodMode9:
   - If you are prompted to select a language, use the D-Pad and press (A) to select English
     - This language choice only affects GodMode9's menu options
     - You can set it to your language of choice after completing this guide
   - If you are prompted to create an essential files backup, press (A) to do so, then press (A) to continue
   - אם אתם מתבקשים לתקן את זמן ותאריך הRTC, תלחצו (A) כדי לעשות זאת, ואז תלחצו (A) כדי להמשיך
5. Once you see [root] and a list of drives, press (Home) to bring up the action menu
6. תבחרו "Scripts..." (_not_ Lua scripts)
7. Select "finalize"
8. Follow the prompts in the script, answering any questions that you are asked
   - If you see "Information #05: No title database", press (A) and enter the key combination on the bottom screen to proceed
   - If you encounter an error, follow the instructions in the error message or consult the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting-finalizing-setup) page, then open GodMode9 by holding (Start) on boot to re-run the script
9. Once the script says "Setup complete!", press (A) to power off the device
   - If you do NOT see the message "Setup complete!", the script was not successful and you will need to redo this section from Step 3
10. תכניסו את ה-SD שלכם למחשב
11. Copy the `/gm9/backups/` folder to a safe location on your computer
    - This folder contains critical file backups and should be backed up to multiple locations (i.e. cloud storage) if possible
    - The two SysNAND files are your NAND backup and can be used to revert your console to a working state if it is bricked by a software issue
    - The `essential.exefs` file contains your console's system-unique files and can be used to recover your data in the event of a hardware failure
12. If you still have them, delete the two `SysNAND` files from the `/gm9/backups/` folder from your SD card
    - The `essential.exefs` file is small and may be kept on your SD card for ease of access

### Information and Notes

::: info

Here are some key combos that you should know:

- Holding (Select) on boot will launch the Luma3DS configuration menu.
- Holding (Start) on boot will launch GodMode9, or if you have multiple payloads in `/luma/payloads/`, the Luma3DS chainloader.
- By default, pressing (Left Shoulder) + (Down D-Pad) + (Select) while in 3DS mode will open the Rosalina menu, where you can check system information, take screenshots, enable cheats, and more. This can be changed from the Rosalina menu.
- Holding (Start) + (Select) + (X) on boot will make the notification LED show a color for debug purposes. See the [changelog](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap/releases/tag/1.4) for a list.

### Pretendo

Pretendo is a replacement service for the Nintendo Network, which resurrects online services from the now shut down Nintendo Network. It also revives the Miiverse service, via juxtaposition. The official guide can be found [here](https://pretendo.network/docs/install/3ds).

**Note: Pretendo does not support every online service, however work is being done to achieve this.**

A list of games that Pretendo supports can be found [here](https://wiki.pretendo.zip/game-support-status).
