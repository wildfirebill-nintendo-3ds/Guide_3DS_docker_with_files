## Troubleshooting

- guiformat shows the error "Failed to open device: GetLastError()=32"
    - Close everything that may be using the SD card, such as any File Explorer windows.
    - If this issue persists, try reformatting the card to NTFS in File Explorer, close that window when it's done, and re-attempt the guiformat process.

- guiformat shows the error "GetLastError()=1117"
    - Your SD card write-protection switch may be [enabled](/images/sdlock.png). The lock must be flipped upwards to allow writing to the SD card (including formatting).

- SD card remains undetected by console or continues to display the wrong capacity after formatting
    - Your SD card may be partitioned or have unallocated space. Follow the instructions [here](https://wiki.hacks.guide/wiki/SD_Clean/Windows) to reformat your SD card.
